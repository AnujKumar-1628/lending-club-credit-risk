Business Problem Definition 

Business Context
This project focuses on consumer credit underwriting for an online lending platform that offers fixed-term personal loans to individual borrowers. When a customer applies for a loan, the business must make a decision quickly and consistently, balancing the need to grow the loan portfolio with the need to control credit risk.
Personal loans are unsecured, meaning losses from default cannot be recovered through collateral. As a result, the quality of underwriting decisions directly impacts portfolio performance, profitability, and long-term sustainability of the lending business.

Decision to Be Made
At the moment a customer submits a loan application, the risk team must decide whether the application should be approved or rejected. This decision is typically automated for the majority of applications due to high volume and strict response-time requirements.
The decision is made using information provided by the applicant and credit-bureau attributes available at the time of application. Once the loan is approved and funded, the decision cannot be reversed.

Impact of Incorrect Decisions
Incorrect approval decisions have direct financial and operational consequences. Approving high-risk applicants increases default rates, leading to principal losses, higher collection costs, and reduced investor confidence. On the other hand, rejecting low-risk applicants reduces interest income, limits portfolio growth, and negatively impacts customer experience.
The business objective is to minimize expected credit losses while maintaining acceptable approval rates and sustainable portfolio performance over time.

Objective of This Project
The model developed in this project serves as a decision-support tool for underwriting and does not replace business judgment or policy constraints.
