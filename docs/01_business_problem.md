Business Problem 

Lending companies give loans to customers and expect them to pay back the money over time. However, not all customers repay their loans fully. Some customers stop paying and the loan is marked as charged off, which causes financial loss to the company.

The goal of this project is to predict the risk of loan default at the time when a loan application is received. This helps the lending company decide whether to approve the loan, reject it, or apply stricter conditions.

We treat this as a binary classification problem:
1 - Loan is likely to be charged off / default
0 - Loan is likely to be fully paid

The prediction is made before the loan is issued, using only the information available at application time.
