# Limitations and Future Work

## Current Limitations
- No experiment tracking system
- No monitoring or drift detection
- No optimized decision threshold
- No fairness or bias analysis

## Possible Improvements
- Add experiment tracking (e.g. MLflow)
- Add data and prediction drift monitoring
- Incorporate business cost-based evaluation
- Using cloud
