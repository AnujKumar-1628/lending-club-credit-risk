# Models

Two models are trained and evaluated in this project.

## Logistic Regression with SGD
- Used as a baseline model
- Simple and interpretable
- Helps understand directional impact of features

## XGBoost
- Used as the primary performance-oriented model
- Captures non-linear feature interactions
- Commonly used for tabular credit risk problems

Both models output probability scores rather than hard class labels.
